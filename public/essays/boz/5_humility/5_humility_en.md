# 🧠 Humility

> If you were raised in a different environment - you would think differently.  
> So don’t be a fanatic of your own ideas. Be someone who seeks truth.

## 🧪 Experiment

One group inflicted physical pain on another for breaking the rules.  
Surprisingly - the first group felt completely justified.

🧩 This shows how much our behavior depends on **context**, **environment**, and **norms**, not on some “inner essence.”

## 💡 Insight

What you think is the result of:

- upbringing
- environment
- culture
- randomness

And this can **change**.  
So don’t make a cult out of your identity or beliefs.

## ✅ Actions

- ❌ Don’t identify yourself with opinions, status, or views
- ❓ Allow for the possibility you might be wrong
- 🎭 Don’t chase rigid identity - it limits you
- 🔍 Don’t make a religion out of your beliefs
- 🤔 Doubt - it makes you wiser
- 🗣 Let others express themselves
- 🧠 Try to understand others' motives before judging
