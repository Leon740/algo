# Get it done

> After thinking do it, while doing don't think(hesitate).

**Do or do not. There is no try.**

## Difficulties with task

- Do not perceive it as a mega challenge.
- Just **ask for help**.
- Double check if it's not clear.

## Got stuck

- Find **a teacher** â€” even one is enough.
- Find **those who live with it**, and address your questions.
- Find **a partner**, to grow together.

## Mental overload

- **Speak out** with a therapist.
- **Talk to a frined**. Do not keep it inside.

## If you want to - do it

- Want **to ask her out**? Say it.  
  Quick. Staright. Like a man.
- **Understatement** between?  
  Talk about this. It's better than building illusions.

> ğŸ§  Keep it simple: do not overthink, do it.
