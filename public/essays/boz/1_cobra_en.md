# Incentives and the Cobra Effect

There was once a problem with a high population of cobras in colonial India. In an effort to fix it, the government began offering rewards for every dead cobra.

At first, the idea seemed to work. But soon, people started breeding cobras just to kill them and claim the bounty. Eventually, when the government realized what was happening, they canceled the program - and the now-worthless cobras were released into the wild. The result? Even more cobras than before.

This is the Cobra Effect: when a well-meaning incentive ends up worsening the original problem.

## Example 1: Import Taxes

Let’s say the government places taxes on imported goods. The goal? To stimulate local production by making foreign products more expensive.

At first glance, this seems like a smart way to protect local businesses. But here’s what often happens instead:

❌ Problem

- Prices rise because local manufacturers still rely on imported components.
- Prices rise again due to monopolies - local producers no longer need to compete.
- Quality drops - there’s no reason to improve if consumers are forced to buy your product.
- Innovation slows - if customers are guaranteed, what’s the motivation to grow?

In short, the consumer suffers while producers become complacent.

✅ Solution

- Invest in multiple sectors of the economy: education, technology, infrastructure, and culture.
- Remove import taxes and challenge local producers to compete globally.

This forces internal improvement - not through artificial restrictions, but through excellence. It elevates processes, standards, and expectations on both sides - producers and consumers.

## Example 2: Subscription Plans

Imagine you’re choosing between three subscription plans: A, B, and C - where C is the premium “all-inclusive” tier.

Choosing A or B usually gives the provider a clear incentive: to make your experience better so that you’ll upgrade.
But once you’re on Plan C, the provider’s goal shifts - they just want you to stay. There’s no longer a reason to improve your experience.

The Takeaway

Never buy the most expensive plan - not unless you’re sure it’s maintained at the highest quality.
Sometimes, being just below the top gives you the best service.

## Final Thought

Whether it’s in business, policy, or personal life - incentives are powerful tools.
But when designed poorly, they can create the very problems they were meant to solve.

The key is to think two steps ahead:
What behavior are you really encouraging?
And what happens when people optimize for the incentive itself?

As Sam Altman said:
“Incentives are superpowers - set them carefully.”
