# Be Plainspoken

**The ability to express yourself clearly is a powerful skill.**  
But with great power comes great responsibility: your words can **bring people closer**, or **push them away**.

## When Speech Becomes Overloaded

We start to speak unnaturally when:

- We want to **impress**
- We want to **fit in**  
  (writing “like everyone else”, following “corporate tone”)
- We want to **avoid conflict** or be “nice”
- We **assume too much** about what others think

## The Solution — Be Open

- **Say what you truly mean**  
  Simply. Clearly. To the point.

- **Don’t assume — ask**  
  Clarify. Double-check. Don’t make up stories.

- **Be present**  
  Don’t drift into the past or hypothetical future.

## How to Apply

### At Work

> Instead of:  
> _“A decision has been made to potentially optimize existing processes.”_  
> Say:  
> _“We decided to simplify the process.”_

### In Sports

> _“I’m tired, I need a break.”_  
> _“Can you explain it again? I didn’t understand.”_

### In Love

> _“Your response matters to me.”_  
> _“I'm struggling, and I want to talk.”_  
> _“I didn’t get what you meant — can you tell me?”_

## Final Thought

**Plain speech is courage.**  
Not to win, but to understand.  
Not to conquer, but to connect.
