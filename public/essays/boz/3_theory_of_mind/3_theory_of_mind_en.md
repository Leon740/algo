# Theory of Mind or Influence

What is a real connection with someone?
It’s the ability to understand how they think — their principles, values, and how they make decisions.

When you understand that, you can better anticipate what they expect from you.

In conversation:

- Share why you think the way you do
- Reveal the principles behind your words and actions

_But don’t overwhelm them._
Keep your answers short and clear.
Then ask:

“Would you like to hear more context?”
