# 🧠 Selection and the Bubble

Your thinking, ideas, and beliefs are shaped by:

- the communities you're part of
- the people you interact with
- the information you consume

This is called **selection bias** — you only see what's around you.  
But that’s not the whole reality.

## 🌍 How to Break Out of the Bubble

- 🛑 **Don’t be afraid of anyone or anything**  
  Do what you can, with what you have, right where you are.

- 💗 **Accept yourself**  
  Love yourself. Trust yourself. Don’t tear yourself down.  
  **You are the one person you’ll always have.**

- 🎭 **Be yourself**  
  Let the rest fall away — what’s meant to stay, will stay.

- ❓ **Question everything**  
  Especially your own beliefs.

- 🧪 **Try new things**  
  Small steps. A new book. A new person. A new place.
