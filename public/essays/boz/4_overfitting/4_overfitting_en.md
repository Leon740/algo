# 🧠 Overfitting

## ❌ The Overfitting Mistake

We tend to draw **broad conclusions from just one or a few experiences**:

- ✖ "She doesn't love me - no one ever will"
- ✖ "I got negative feedback - I must be terrible"А
- ✖ "I failed once - this isn't for me"

🔄 But the truth is: it was a **local, specific case - not a global rule**.

## 🌍 Problem Globalization

You might talk to friends or read online:
_"Yeah, same thing happened to me."_  
And suddenly you think:  
**"Guess this is just how the world works. Nothing I can do."**

⚠️ But similarity ≠ sameness.  
Even if many share a problem - **each case has its own cause and solution**.

> 🎯 Treat it as local: **What exactly went wrong in your case, and what can you do about it?**

## ✅ What To Do

- 🧩 **Frame the issue locally**, not globally
- 🧠 **Refine your model** - don't reject too fast, think deeper
- 🛠 **Try again**, instead of writing it off completely
- 📍 **Be specific**: When, how, and why did it happen?

## 💬 Mental Reframe

❌ "This doesn't work - it's a global problem"  
✅ "This didn’t work this time. What can I try differently?"
