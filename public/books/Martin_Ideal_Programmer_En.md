# 1 General principles

## You are responsible for your work.

Not your manager, not the team lead, but you.

## Quality Assurance should find nothing.

Noone will double check you. Work the way as if there's no quality control engineers.

## Which code is bad? - the one which you're not confident it.

## Boyscout rule

While working with a module, make it better than it was.

## Test driven development helps to

- build a strong architecture - composition - structure
  (to test this large func you need to split it into multiple funcs)

## Self development

Noone cares about your desires, goals etc. You need to develop yourself. Read tech blogs, subscribe to frameworks events.
40 hours a week work. 20 hours a week study.
No, it's not overtime, you just need to pay attention to your time consumption.
Stay up-to-date. You don't want to use a doctor who's work principles are 20 years old.

## Specialization

Be strong in your specialization.
Frameworks, etc. Deep knowledge.

## Domain

Understand the purpose of the project domain, company values.

# 2 How to say No

## Define requirements

Split time or amount of work into stages. On this stage you are working only on this, after this stage you can work on it's updates.
People don't clearly know what they want. This is the reason of high amount of updates.

## Discuss the resources

I need this amount of time and people.

## Do not let pressure to influence you

If the deadlines are though etc, tell about this, or your problem.
Managers have their goals, and you have yours.

## Overtime

No. They will unbalance your power.

## Do not try

Once all of the above is done, it's time to work. Not attempting, but completing. Take a decision to complete this task, project.

## Do not be a hero

No, you are not able to complete it by the end of this week. No overtime. You are not a hero.

# 3 How to say Yes

## Promise language

Falsy promises
I should start hitting the jym.
Hopefully I will finish this task today.

True promises
I am hitting the gym 3 times a week. I got my gear, training program, trainer and a friend.
I will finish this task today. If not sure, say tomorrow.

Difference
Deterministic

## Common issues

If this doesn't depend fully on you, but on another department, engineer.
Currently I am working on this. I faced this issue. I reached out to this engineer from this department. He said he needs 1 day to push his fix. After that, I will need 8 more hours to push my updates.

## Daily calls

Yesterday I worked on this.
Today I am working on this. I will finish it in n hours.
Or, I am facing an issue, I reached out to, after that it will take me 8 more hours to finish.

# 4 Coding

## Blind typing

You know which keys to press. You don't press him when you are not confident. Since you don't know the solution or many other reasons below.

Typing is similar to

- pianist fingers
- soccer person feet

Your fingers are performing low level task, and brain high level task.
In order to save all of the energy for brain, learn to blind type.

## Concentration

Coding requires concentration which physically is a hard to maintain state.
There is a long list of task, meetings, every day life issues.
Cool off, and then code.

## Night

Think that working at night shows how you love what you're doing? - No.
Instead, use 8 hours a day.
However, if this is the only one option to go, do
10-10:45 Work
11-11:45 Work
12-12:45 Work

Working at night, requires extra effort, and unbalances your body hours, which leads to productivity loss.

## Anxiety

Do not make yourself code.
Analyse, Why you feel this? What should you do to fix this?
Write it down.
Toyota 5 principles.

## Basic

Eat, Sleep, Sex, Sport, Society.

## Flow

A state of high concentration.

Problem
The entire image (goal) is blurred, because of speed you make not the greatest solutions.

Solution
Stop. Reflect. Why? Toyota 5 principles.

## Music

Helps to get into the flow.
Distracts.
Uses resources.

## Stuck

Ask for help
Pair programming
Greedy Algo: Do the first step you know
Inspiration: movies, books, people.
Hobby, Primitive tasks - distract from work.

## Schedule

You will be running late. It's ok. Just don't give up, keep going.

## Rush

Do not let the pressure take you.

## Overtime

Only you have resources for this.
If it's not gonna take longer than a week.
Chief has a plan for the worst case.

# 5 TDD

Test first.
Code for this test.
Repeat.

## Composition

To test this func, split it into multiple funcs.

## Regular build

Following the certain stages.

## Editing existing

Not being afraid to edit.

## Documentation

Following the certain stages.

# 6 Trainings

new languages, frameworks
pet projects
open source
volunteering
challenges (lc, etc)

# 7 Time

## Meetings

What is the goal, plan of the meeting?
What is your goal on this meeting?
Always have and share a plan for the meeting.
Record meetings for others.
I prefer attending many meetings and have some extra knowledge instead of doing smth, which will not be used or will have to be updated.

## Arguments

Create RFC, a doc with comments.
Participants write down their thoughts, share them.
When you write you formulate, rethink, analyze better.
Doc is stored and can be accessed at any time.

## Concentration

Problem

- anxiety
  Write it down, Analyze.

- every day life issues
  Write it down, Analyze.

- lack of sleep
  Take a nap, Balance life.

- stimulators (coffee etc.)
  Do not overuse.

- distraction (phone, background noise, etc)
  Focus mode, Basement.

- recharge
  Sport, Mediation, Book, Nap

- inspiration
  Books, Movies, people

## Pomodoro

45 m Work
10 m Diff
5 m Break

## Priorities Inversion

1st task is boring or hard or solution not found, but it's the most important task.
2nd task is fun, easy, but has lower priority.
Often, the 2nd task will be the first to work on.
Cool off, follow the priorities list.

## Closure

There are 2 solutions for the problem.
Decided to go with the 1st.
After some time realized that it's not working 100%.
Instead of switching to 2nd, 1st is kept.
This is called closure. Since much resources were payed to the 1st, the switch to 2nd is getting harder.
In this case, stop digging a pit. The longer you go with 1st the deeper you get.
Professional is ready to switch any time between his solutions, ideas etc.

## Dirt

Similar to pit but worse.
There is a solution to this problem or a feature developed.
After some updates, time etc. other features override existing, or other issues.
It means the wrong architecture solution was taken.
Instead of making dirt with current solution switch to another one and redo from scratch.
